                    Dr. Aubin serves as an Artistic Director for The Chelsea
                    Symphony in New York City. The Chelsea Symphony is a
                    dynamic, self-governing ensemble with a major cultural
                    presence in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. It presents
                    music of the highest caliber while upending the traditional
                    hierarchy of the classical orchestra: our musicians rotate
                    as featured soloists, conductors, and composers.
